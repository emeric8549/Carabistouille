# Carabistouille

Welcome to **Carabistouille**!  
The goal of this repository is to centralise different projects that I have been working on. \
As designing complex models is what I find most challenging, I am focusing mainly on implementing deep learning models from the literature. I also want to explore different kind of dataset, from tabular data and images to music and texts.  
All the models are trained using my own hardware so some of them may not deliver sufficient performance due to high computing costs or a lack of RAM.  
  
Below are the projects I have done so far and those that I plan to do (this is a non-exhaustive list)  


## **Projects fully finished:**
    Work in progress

## **Ongoing projects:**
    - mlp-numpy (code implemented, still need visualizations)
    - resnet (code implemented, have to train the model on at least 100 epochs and compare performance with a simple CNN)
    - unet (architecture done, still need a pipeline for training)
    - word2vec (just started)
    - reinforcement learning I: minesweeper-rl (environment created + started episode creation and monitoring with tensorboard)


## **Future projects:**
    - auto-encoder
    - transformer
    - use case on NLP (maybe do that in transformer)
    - use case on time series (with a music dataset)
    - hackathon (ViT on plankton images)
    - polytechnique project (scientific papers classification using GNN)
    - IoT project using ML on a Raspberry pi (would be lovely)
    - reinforcement learning II: solve a Rubik's cube
    - reinforcement learning III: create an environment with Unity and ML-agents
    - diffusion model
    - neural ordinary differential equations
    - simple LLM (use vectorDB and Langchain)
    - create agent on a pre-trained LLM
