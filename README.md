# Carabistouille

Welcome to **Carabistouille**!  
The goal of this repository is to centralise different projects that I have been working on. \
As designing complex models is what I find most challenging, I am focusing mainly on implementing deep learning models from the literature. I also want to explore different kind of dataset, from tabular data and images to music and texts.  
All the models are trained using my own hardware so some of them may not deliver sufficient performance due to high computing costs or a lack of RAM.  
  
Below are the projects I have done so far and those that I plan to do (this is a non-exhaustive list)  


## **Projects fully finished:**
Work in progress

## **Ongoing projects:**
- mlp-numpy
- resnet
- unet
- word2vec
- reinforcement learning I: minesweeper-rl
- auto-encoder
- hackathon (plankton images classification)


## **Future projects:**
- transformer
- use case on NLP (maybe do that in transformer)
- use case on time series (with a music dataset)
- polytechnique project (scientific papers classification using GNN)
- IoT project using ML on a Raspberry pi (would be lovely)
- reinforcement learning II: solve a Rubik's cube
- reinforcement learning III: create an environment with Unity and ML-agents
- diffusion model
- neural ordinary differential equations
- simple LLM (use vectorDB and Langchain)
- create agent on a pre-trained LLM
