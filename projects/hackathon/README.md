# Hackathon

In this project, I present the work I have done with a colleague during a hackathon in June 2021.  
This hackathon has been created by Veolia and the foundation Tara Océan with the aim of classifying plankton images among more than 80 classes. One of the main challenges was to build a frugal model that was able to run on a Raspberry Pi. Indeed, the winners saw their project being used by a team of researchers on a boat in the Atlantic Ocean, where it was used to track the evolution of the plankton population at various locations.  

After a whole weekend of coding using multiple approaches, our team won the hackathon and we have been able to meet the team of Tara Océan to learn more about their jobs and mission.
