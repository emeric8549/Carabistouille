# Auto-encoders

One of the early generative models, able to create totally new images by picking a random vector in the latent space (i.e. the bottleneck of the model) 

### Work to do:
    - implement pipeline to colorize image (AE with skip connections)
    - implement pipeline to unblur image (AE with skip connections)
    - implement pipeline to create new numbers (random vectors in latent space using MNIST) (AE without skip connections)
    - create VAE
